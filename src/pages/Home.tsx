        Hello! I'm Leland Clemmons, a software engineer who loves making
        accessible frontends load quickly. I code in Typescript and React.js,
        but I've also made a bevy of CI/CD tools in Node.js, Python, and shell
        scripts.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've made design systems, e-commerce apps, frontend performance checks,
        developer experience tools, and more.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also love to teach! I've led teams in learning React, the advanced
        parts of git, React, accessibility (e.g WCAG and ARIA), and beyond.
      </p>
